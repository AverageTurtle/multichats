# The Basics of Alliance Chatrooms

Every alliance gets their own private ingame 
chatroom to converse and discuss things in.
Any member of the alliance will receive the messages sent in this chatroom, 
and will be able to reply. 

You can switch your chat to any alliance you are a member of using the `/sc <name>`
command. Using `/sc` without any arguments brings you back to global chat.

If the owner of an alliance has set a message prefix, you can prefix your
message with that to send it to the alliance chat without using any commands.
For example, if an alliance's message prefix is `t:`, you can type 
`t:This is a message` into your chat bar to send `This is a message` to the
alliance chat.
