# Alliance Ownership

Creating an alliance is covered [on the homepage]. 
It is recommended to only create an alliance if 
you have or are planning to create a form of ingame player group.
Staff might at any time delete alliances that aren't used for this purpose.

### Cosmetics

After you've created your alliance you can start customizing
it. You have several options for visual customization:
The display name and the short display name.
The normal display name is the alliance name
*with* punctuation, capitalization and [custom formatting] like colors.
It shows up in a bunch of places like command responses and the tab menu.
The short display name is just a shorter version of the normal display name,
it should be about one to three characters long and clear
to belong to your alliance at a glance. This also supports formatting.
To set your display name and short display name use
`/alliance modify displayName "<name>"` and `/alliance modify displayNameShort "<name>"` respectively,
the quotes around the name are important if you want to use custom formatting.

### The Message Prefix

As discussed [here], having a message prefix is a very 
convenient thing for alliance members.
By default, an alliance has no message prefix set. Thus, 
it's a good idea to set one right away.
A message prefix should be less than 4 characters long,
easy to type quickly, and unique to your alliance.
It also cannot contain any special characters.
Recommended format is something like `AU` if your alliance
is called `Among Us`. When applied, a `:` is automatically 
appended to the end of the prefix. Meaning if you set your prefix to `AU`,
players would use `AU:This is message` to send a message to your chat.

### Managers

For larger alliances, an alliance owner can assign certain members to be managers.
These members can send invites and kick other members on the owner's behalf.
If you decide to add managers to your alliance, make sure you trust them.
Managers can't change any alliance settings.
