Welcome to the alliances wiki. 
Alliances is a custom system to help manage cities and player groups.
For example: you could have a city where the major owns an alliance, 
and all the people living in the city are part of it.
Or you and your mates could have a base together, 
and you want to make clear that you're all part of a group.

### Benefits

This brings us to the benefits of having an alliance. 
At the moment there are only two, but that may expand later:

- A [private chatroom] in the ingame chat.
- Your primary alliance name next to your name in the tablist.
- A home location you can teleport to from anywhere. (Only if your alliance has more than 3 [primary members])

[private chatroom]: chatrooms-basics.md
[primary members]: primary-members.md

### Joining an alliance

To join an alliance, you have to receive an invite from an alliance owner or manager.
So if you see an alliance you want to join, 
asking around for a bit will generally get you in if they're accepting new members.

You can join as many alliances as you want, but some 
might not accept you if you're gonna two-time them.
If you do join multiple alliances, the one that shows up next 
to your name in the tab menu is decided by your [primary alliance] setting.
This can be configured using the `/alliance primary set <name>` command,
Or you can reset it to the default with `/alliance primary reset`.

For more info, check out the [general command reference], [chatrooms basics] and [primary alliance] pages.

### Creating an alliance

Creating an alliance is as easy as using the command 
`/alliance create <name>` where the name is the name people 
will use to interact with your alliance (not the display name).
Since this is the name people will have to type every time they 
run commands to do with your alliance, it should be short, 
simple and *without* punctuation or capitalization. Keep in mind that this 
**cannot be changed later** and you can 
only own **one alliance per player**.
