# Primary alliance

When you are a member of multiple alliances at once, you can choose **only one** to set as your primary alliance.
This is the alliance that will be displayed next to your name in the tablist.
Some alliance features are restricted to primary members, like teleporting to the home location.

You can configure your primary alliance using `/alliance primary set <name>`.
It is also possible to reset it back to being empty, even if you're still part of an alliance, using `/alliance primary reset`.
This will make you appear as "Wanderer" on the tablist.
Keep in mind that making changes to your primary alliance comes with a 10 minute cooldown.

### Primary member count

The amount of members of an alliance that have it set as primary is called the primary member count,
this is the most accurate way to guage the actual size of an alliance.
This is why some benefits are restricted to alliances with a minimum amount of primary members.
The following is a list of restricted features:

- 3 primary members: home location.
